                <strong>If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong>

            <p>
                I would eat <em>pizza</em> for the rest of my life because it is very versatile.

            <h2>Modern Slang I Wish Would Go Away</h2>
            <p><strong>Slang:</strong> "The Ick"</p>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Used to refer to a sudden feeling of disgust or repulsion to a partner or someone you are attracted to.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I Don't Like It:</strong> It has been used to nit-pick character traits about other people, <a href="https://studenthut.com/articles/ultimate-list-icks">one source describes it as "irrational turn-offs."</a> It is an easy way to demean people's character, and I have seen it been used in that way many times.</p>

            <h2>Recent Article I Liked</h2>
            <p>I don't read news articles much. I mostly listen to news podcasts/shows that cover a wide range of topics.</p>
            <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LMGClips/videos">The WAN Show Clips</a></p>
            <p><strong>Why I Liked It:</strong> I enjoy listening to/watching the WAN show, a weekly news show about the tech industry, in the background of doing daily activities (schoolwork, showers, cooking, etc). It helps me keep up to date on the tech industry, which is something I am passionate about. It also helps me inform my friends and family about any important things happening that they would otherwise not know about.</p>
